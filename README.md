## About the Mod
**Shadows of the Abyss** is a terrifying Minecraft mod that launches players into a world where survival is not only a chore, but an abhorrent affair.

This mod reimagines the Nether as a haunting, twisted dimension with many unspeakable terrors lurking within.  
The familiar biomes twist into a sinister landscapeâ€”perpetually darkâ€”filled with grotesque creatures whose advanced AI allows them to hunt players relentlessly. The once-vibrant glow of the Nether is replaced by strange colors and quivering shadows that almost seem to have a life of their own.

Ruins deep in the Nether hold powerful artifacts and cryptic lore, but delving too deep may awaken terrible curses.
